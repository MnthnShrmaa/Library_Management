### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
SELECT * FROM books;
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES ('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
SELECT * FROM members;
UPDATE members
SET member_address = 'bhai ka bageecha'
WHERE member_id = 'C109';
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status;
SELECT * FROM issued_status
where issued_id = 'IS121';
DELETE FROM issued_status
where issued_id = 'IS121';
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101'
```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT issued_member_id,
COUNT(issued_book_name) AS no_of_books_issued 
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY issued_member_id
HAVING COUNT(issued_book_name)>1;
```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_issued_table AS
SELECT b.isbn,
b.book_title,
count(st.issued_member_id) AS book_issued_cnt
FROM books as b
JOIN issued_status AS st
ON b.isbn = st.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY b.isbn, b.book_title;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

**Task 7: Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

**Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT 
	b.category,
	SUM(b.rental_price)	as total_income
FROM books as b
JOIN issued_status as sb

GROUP BY b.category;
```

**Task 9: List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= date_sub(current_date(), INTERVAL 180 DAY);
```

**Task 10: List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql
SELECT 
	e1.emp_name,
    e1.branch_id,
    b.branch_address,
    e1.salary,
    e2.emp_name as managers_name
FROM branch as b
JOIN employees as e1
ON b.branch_id=e1.branch_id
JOIN employees as e2
on e2.emp_id = b.manager_id;
```

**Task 11: Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE books_above_4
AS SELECT * 
FROM books
WHERE rental_price>4;
SELECT * FROM books_above_4;
```

**Task 12: Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT 
            s.issued_id,
    s.issued_member_id,
    s.issued_book_name,
    s.issued_date,
    s.issued_book_isbn,
    s.issued_emp_id
FROM return_status as r
RIGHT JOIN issued_status as s
ON r.issued_id = s.issued_id
WHERE r.return_id IS NULL;

```

## Advanced SQL Operations

**Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books**  
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's_id, member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

```sql
SELECT 
	m.member_id,
    m.member_name,
    b.book_title,
    s.issued_date,
    r.return_date,
    (current_date()-s.issued_date) AS overdue_days
FROM members as m
JOIN issued_status as s
	ON m.member_id = s.issued_member_id
JOIN books as b
	ON b.isbn = s.issued_book_isbn
LEFT JOIN return_status as r
	ON r.issued_id = s.issued_id
WHERE 
	r.return_date IS NULL
    AND
    (current_date()-s.issued_date) > 650
ORDER BY m.member_id;
```


**Task 14: Update Book Status on Return**  
Write a query to update the status of books in the books table to "Yes" when they are returned (based on entries in the return_status table).


```sql

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE add_return_book(return_idp VARCHAR(30), issued_idp VARCHAR(30))

BEGIN
	DECLARE v_isbn VARCHAR(30);
    
	INSERT INTO return_status(return_id, issued_id, return_date)
    VALUES
		(return_idp, issued_idp, CURRENT_DATE());
        
	SELECT issued_book_isbn 
		INTO v_isbn
    FROM issued_status
    WHERE issued_id = issued_idp;
    
    UPDATE books
    SET status = 'yes'
    WHERE isbn = v_isbn;
    
    SELECT 'THANK YOU FOR RETURNING THE BOOK' as message;
END $$

DELIMITER ;

-- calling procedure
CALL add_return_book('RS119', 'IS126');
CALL add_return_book('RS120', 'IS135');

```




**Task 15: Branch Performance Report**  
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.

```sql
-- employees -> issued_status -> return_status -> books

CREATE TABLE branch_report
AS
SELECT 
	e.branch_id,
	COUNT(e.emp_id) as books_issued_count,
    COUNT(r.return_id) as returned_books_count,
    SUM(b.rental_price) AS total_revenue
FROM employees as e
	JOIN 
    issued_status as st
		ON e.emp_id = st.issued_emp_id
	LEFT JOIN 
    return_status as r
		ON st.issued_id = r.issued_id
	JOIN 
    books as b
		ON b.isbn = st.issued_book_isbn
	GROUP BY e.branch_id
	ORDER BY e.branch_id;
    
SELECT * FROM branch_report;
```

**Task 16: CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members**  
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 2 months.

```sql

CREATE TABLE active_member1
AS
SELECT 
	m.member_id,
    m.member_name,
    COUNT(st.issued_book_isbn) AS issued_books_cnt
FROM members as m
LEFT JOIN issued_status as st
ON m.member_id = st.issued_member_id
WHERE 
	issued_date >= current_date() - interval 7 month
GROUP BY 
	m.member_id,
    m.member_name;

-- ALTERNATIVE

CREATE TABLE active_member2
AS
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE member_id IN (
					SELECT issued_member_id
                    FROM issued_status
                    WHERE 
                    issued_date >= current_date()- INTERVAL 7 month
                    )
                    ;

```


**Task 17: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed**  
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

```sql
-- issued_status -> employees -> branch
SELECT 
	e.branch_id,
	e.emp_name,
    COUNT(issued_book_isbn) AS book_processed_cnt
FROM issued_status as st
JOIN 
	employees as e
    ON st.issued_emp_id = e.emp_id
GROUP BY e.emp_name,e.branch_id
ORDER BY COUNT(issued_book_isbn) DESC
LIMIT 3;
```



**Task 18: Stored Procedure**
Objective:
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
Description:
Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows:
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE issue_book(p_issued_id VARCHAR(30), p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(30), 
							p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(30), p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(30))
                            
BEGIN
	DECLARE v_status varchar(30);
    
    SELECT 
        status 
        INTO
        v_status
    FROM books
    WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;
    
	IF v_status = 'yes' THEN

		INSERT INTO issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
        VALUES
        (p_issued_id, p_issued_member_id, current_date(), p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);

        UPDATE books
            SET status = 'no'
        WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

        SELECT 'Book records added successfully for book isbn : ' AS message, p_issued_book_isbn;
		
        ELSE
        SELECT 'Sorry to inform you the book you have requested is unavailable book_isbn: ' AS message, p_issued_book_isbn;
		END IF;
        
END $$

DELIMITER ;

-- Testing The function
SELECT * FROM books;
-- "978-0-553-29698-2" -- yes
-- "978-0-375-41398-8" -- no
SELECT * FROM issued_status;

CALL issue_book('IS155', 'C108', '978-0-553-29698-2', 'E104');
CALL issue_book('IS156', 'C108', '978-0-375-41398-8', 'E104');

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE isbn = '978-0-375-41398-8'

```
